iPhone 6 Frame

Synopsis: Creating a display piece, similar to the ones from GRID, using an old iPhone 6.

1. Diassembly: fairly straightforward, just using a precision screwdriver. Some parts needed to be pried apart with a spudger.
2. Creating template: Laid out components on a piece of tabloid sized paper, scanned it using a phone. Imported the image to GIMP to add text (using SF Pro Display font)
